## Introduction
Static web project with HTML5 and CSS3 about the ecommerce of the clothing brand Blue Banana Brand.
In this project, I have practiced various CSS3 concepts:
- Responsive design
- Dropdown menu
- Dynamic banner with information
- Different types of buttons
- Layers
- Carousels
- Hovers
- Link lists


## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3


>[!NOTE]
> There are buttons that would need JavaScript code to resemble the original website.
> The dropdown menu I used as an example is the shopping cart.
> Some images have a dark border due to the difficulty of obtaining the images.
> The images on the original website changed as I was working on the project, which is why some images are out of order or do not match exactly.
